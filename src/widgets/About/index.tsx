        <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Konstantin. Nice to meet you.</h3>
        <p>I have been successfully developing web interfaces for over 5 years.</p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being a front-end developer because I am responsible for implementing the
          front-end of the application, how the back-end and design interact with the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the application behaves on different screen resolutions and accessibility for people
          with disabilities depends on my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops.
        </p>
